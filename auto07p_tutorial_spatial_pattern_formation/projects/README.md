#Auto sample projects

The following three sample projects help getting more familiar with auto07p.

* [Demo pp2](auto-circle): if you would like to use prepared auto files, try this demo to continue equilibria of the planar ODE, locate and continue saddle-node and Hopf bifurcations, and continue periodic orbits.
* [Circle continuation](auto-pp2-demo): this problem demonstrates how a circle can be traced out using continuation in auto07p.
* [Continuing pulses in reaction-diffusion equations](auto-bistable): this project is about the computation of travelling waves in auto07p via a boundary-value-problem formulation. Starting data come from an explicit solution.

Other projects are listed in the PDF [auto-projects.pdf](auto-projects.pdf)
